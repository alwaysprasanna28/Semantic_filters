# Semantic Filters

This repository is implementation of [Semantically Safe Robot Manipulation:
From Semantic Scene Understanding
to Motion Safeguards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15185)

This repository contains research code for simulating and visualising semantic constraints (e.g., “do not coke above the blue mug”, “keep the coke upright”) around objects such as a mug and a can, and enforcing them via CBF-based controllers.
